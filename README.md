## Main Point

Large incumbents face structural barriers—baseline measurement costs, incentive misalignment, and organizational inertia—that make AI-first transformation nearly impossible. This creates a massive opportunity for domain experts to found startups that serve markets incumbents cannot profitably address.

The same forces that made incumbents powerful now prevent them from going AI-first. This presentation explores the barriers enterprises face when adopting AI and the strategic playbooks for both startups and enterprises to navigate this new landscape.
