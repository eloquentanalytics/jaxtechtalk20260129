# Conference Talk Builder

A skill for creating professional conference presentations from concept to delivery-ready slides.

## Capabilities

1. **Outline Creation**: Build timed slide skeletons with clear structure
2. **Content Integration**: Map research, leverage points, or notes into themed sections
3. **Visual Layout**: Generate ASCII wireframes for each slide showing element placement
4. **Timing Optimization**: Balance content against target duration
5. **Speaker Notes**: Draft talking points for each slide

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Structure
- Define thesis, audience, and duration
- Create high-level section breakdown
- Assign time budgets per section

### Phase 2: Content
- Map source material to slides
- Group related points into coherent barriers/themes
- Write summary bullets (3 per slide max for spoken delivery)

### Phase 3: Visual Design
- Add ASCII layout annotations for each slide
- Specify: layout type, key visual elements, text placement
- Note image/diagram requirements

### Phase 4: Refinement
- Check total runtime against target
- Identify slides to trim or combine
- Ensure narrative flow between sections

## Slide Layout Patterns

Common layouts to recommend:

- **Title**: Centered stack, thesis card, speaker info
- **Comparison**: Two-column (before/after, old/new, incumbent/startup)
- **Process**: Horizontal timeline or progress bar
- **Framework**: Vertical checklist or numbered steps
- **Grid**: 2x2 or 2x3 cards for multiple items
- **Hero Image**: Central image with caption and bullets below
- **Minimal CTA**: Large text block with single question

## Output Format

Each slide should include:
```
### Slide N: Title (M:SS)
- Bullet points for content

**Visual Layout:**
[ASCII wireframe]
- Layout notes
```
