This document explores the likely experience of existing companies in attempting to transition from their current business models into an AI first model that embraces agentic operations with human support as its primary means of transacting business.

Baseline Requirement & Scale Advantage

To judge whether humans or AI win on any given task, you need a running baseline of AI performance on every task. That means letting the AI handle a statistically significant slice of work even when humans could earn more profit in the short term, and vice versa. Larger firms feel that sacrifice less—the absolute volume they “donate to the baseline” is the same, but it’s a smaller share of their total, making the transition far harder for nimble, smaller competitors, even though other kinds of pressures make it more difficult for larger firms, creating a structural conflict.

Divergent Task Preferences

Recruiters gravitate toward the enjoyable, bonus-rich work; an AI optimizes for speed and quality, no matter how tedious. Left to choose, each party pushes the drudgery onto the other, and humans end up with the repetitive “training” tasks while the AI claims the creative victories. A recruiter-led shop is therefore structurally less efficient than an AI-led one.

Legacy Constraints & Organizational Inertia

Incumbents are tied to existing markets, financing terms, and corporate cultures that prize incremental tweaks over radical shifts. Strong labor protections, employee ownership, and high salary bases hand veto power to the workforce, further slowing any pivot to an AI-first model.

Reputation & Regulatory Headwinds

A firm openly replacing people with algorithms invites bad press and political scrutiny, dampening client and candidate demand. A green-field startup that positions AI as the default—and humans as value-add—avoids that stigma and navigates rules written for yesterday’s operating model.

Efficiency vs. Volume Mindset

Established companies see automation as a way to chop cost from discrete tasks; startups build the whole machine around shoving ever-greater transaction volume through the most automatable channels. The result is two very different competitive arenas.

Compensation Model Misalignment

Placement-based commissions steer recruiters toward easy wins—the very roles leadership wants to hand to AI. Switching to hourly or quality-based pay fixes the incentive—but tanks productivity and spikes turnover—piling more disruption on a business already in flux.

Tooling Overhaul & Vision Drift

An AI workforce needs AI-native ATSs and workflow tools, most of which haven’t been built. AI-native tools will emphasize task-based orientation instead of the ability to do many different tasks in any order like SAAS tools are build today. Replacing legacy systems is pricey, so finance assumes the old stack will be decommissioned. Under real-world pressure, new tools slowly morph to resemble the familiar ones, unless leadership and investors lock in a multi-year, non-negotiable commitment to an AI-led process.

AI Bot Integration

The bigger the company, the less likely any given vendor will cover all their use cases, the more likely that they will need to integrate multiple bots, and the mechanics of how multiple AI bots from different vendors can coordinate over the same processes is still very much unknown and probably an order of magnitude more difficult than the relatively straightforward integrations required today, which is already very complex.

Enterprise Vendor Selection

AI is famously easy to build a convincing demo that fails when deployed. The less useful a demo is in understanding the relationship between early demos and final value, the more uncertain the acquisition process, and the harder to get through that process at a large company. If the vendor that ends up winning the deal to deliver a particular AI-driven capability ultimately fails to deliver it, the enterprise is more likely to declare that the capability is not possible with AI than to admit their procurement process made a poor choice.
