# The AI Innovator's Dilemma
## What Do You Do With a Tool That Can Do Anything?

**Thesis:** Large incumbents face structural barriers—baseline measurement costs, incentive misalignment, and organizational inertia—that make AI-first transformation nearly impossible, creating a massive opportunity for domain experts to found startups that serve markets incumbents cannot profitably address.

**Audience:** Mixed (VCs, founders, operators, engineers) at Jax Tech
**Speaker:** Philip O'Donnell
**Duration:** 20 minutes

### Slide 2: Hook — Everything Old Is New Again (1:30)
- AI represents a step change in automating knowledge work (information + communication)
- But the economic patterns follow the same path as previous automation waves
- Assembly line (1913) → Cloud computing (2006) → AI/LLMs (2024)
- Same structural barriers, same disruption patterns

### Slide 3: The Usual Approach to Automation (1:30)
- 80% automation is the usual approach—incremental improvement
- 100% automation is full transformation—a new business model
- The difference between 80% and 100% is not 20%—it's the gap between improvement and transformation
- That 20% is where all the structural barriers live

### Slide 4: The 4 Structural Barriers (Overview) (1:00)

**Framing:** The enterprise AI transformation follows the Hero's Journey—but most enterprises fail at specific stages. Each barrier represents where the journey breaks down.

- **Choosing the Right Path** → Deciding what to sacrifice to enable transformation
- **Preparing for the Journey** → Understanding the full scope of what's needed
- **Navigating the Labyrinth** → The ugly, uncomfortable transition phase
- **Resisting Temptation** → The pull of easy, short-term wins

### Slide 5a: Barrier #1 — Choosing the Right Path: LinkedIn Example (0:45)

**Summary:** Why doesn't LinkedIn do recruiting? They have all the data, all the relationships. The answer: their customers ARE recruiters. This is a concrete example of how existing customer relationships create structural constraints on what you can build.

**Speaker Notes:** "Why doesn't LinkedIn just do recruiting themselves? They have all the data, all the relationships. The answer: their customers ARE recruiters. If LinkedIn launched an AI recruiting service, they'd be directly competing with the people who pay them $10K+ per year for Recruiter licenses. This isn't a strategic choice they're making — it's a structural constraint. Their existing customer base defines what they cannot build."

**Visual:** Single card with the LinkedIn example. Message: "Your existing customers define what you can't build."

### Slide 5b: Barrier #1 — Enterprise Structural Constraints (0:45)

**Summary:** Beyond customer relationships, enterprises are hemmed in by their current structures in multiple ways. These constraints define how they can attack and defend in the market.

**Speaker Notes:** "Enterprises are hemmed in by their current structures in three key ways. These aren't obstacles to overcome with enough willpower — they're the boundaries of the playing field."

**Example Bank (pick and choose live):**

*Existing Customers:*
- LinkedIn: customers ARE recruiters — launching AI recruiting would directly compete with $10K/year Recruiter license holders.
- AWS: they DO compete with customers (Dropbox, Elastic, Tableau) — Walmart and Gap moved to Microsoft/Google clouds.
- Salesforce: acquires companies (Steelbrick, MuleSoft) that compete with AppExchange ISV partners.
- Intuit: customers are accountants — won't launch accounting firm even though they have all the data.

*Cannibalization:*
- Kodak: invented digital camera in 1975, execs said "don't tell anyone" — shelved it, bankruptcy 2012.
- Blockbuster: refused Netflix for $50M — late fees were $800M/year, couldn't sacrifice it, went bankrupt.
- Blockbuster's online service required in-store returns to protect foot traffic — undermined the value proposition.
- Counter-example — Apple: iPhone would cannibalize iPod, Jobs did it anyway ("if we don't, someone else will").

*Channel Conflicts:*
- Ford/GM: all 50 states have franchise laws — Ford CANNOT sell EVs direct, dealers have contractual protection.
- Tesla won exemptions in 26 states only because they NEVER had franchised dealers.
- Rivian CEO called dealership laws "as close as you can get to corruption" — legacy automakers stuck with them.
- Dell: direct sales undercut partner's $250K deal — partner lost commission and trust.
- Cisco 1996: adding direct sales caused resentment, had to create three-tier structure.

**Visual:** Three cards showing Existing Customers ("They vote loudly. Future customers are silent."), Current Revenue ("Cannibalization hits this quarter. New revenue is a spreadsheet."), and Channel Conflicts ("Partners and resellers have contractual protection."). Message: "These aren't obstacles to overcome. They're the boundaries of the playing field."

**Additional Constraint Categories (bonus material in speaker notes):**

*Talent & Skills:*
- AT&T: workforce with outdated skills — launched $1B "Workforce 2020" reskilling initiative, took years.
- 67% of execs think AI skills important, only 3% plan to invest in training.
- One in three employees never trained on new tech they're expected to use.

*Compensation Structures:*
- If reps get paid to chase logos but business depends on multi-year contracts — misalignment.
- Gross margin commissions encourage reps to only sell high-margin products.
- Changing comp plans mid-year is organizational warfare.

*Brand Position:*
- Packard: went downmarket in 1930s-40s, destroyed patrician image, killed brand.
- Cadillac Cimarron: disastrous downmarket attempt in 1980s.
- Mercedes A-Class: went downmarket, failed moose test, quality criticized.
- BMW created Mini as SEPARATE brand to go downmarket without dilution.

*Investor Expectations:*
- Amazon: stock crashed 94% in dot-com bust, Bezos said "stock is not the company," kept investing.
- Broadcom: beat Q4, strong AI forecast, stock dropped 11% on margin compression concerns.
- Figma: punished by Wall Street for saying AI investments would cut into profit.

*Existing Contracts:*
- SAP RISE: must commit for term, no early exit without penalty.
- Multi-year enterprise deals lock you into delivering the old way.
- SLAs requiring human oversight can't be changed unilaterally.

*Pricing Model Lock-in:*
- IDC: "By 2028, pure seat-based pricing will be obsolete."
- Per-seat problem: more successful automation is, fewer seats needed — self-cannibalization.
- 65% of vendors now use hybrid (AI meter on top of seats) — Adobe, Salesforce.

### Slide 5c: Barrier #1 — What To Do About It (0:30)

**Summary:** For enterprises: map your constraints explicitly and build in the negative space. For startups: map their constraints and build exactly there—they can't follow.

**Speaker Notes:** "So what do you do about it? For enterprises: map your constraints explicitly. Don't pretend they don't exist. Which customers would you compete with? Which revenue would you cannibalize? Then build in the negative space — the areas where these constraints don't apply. For startups: do the same analysis, but in reverse. Map their constraints. Who are their sacred customers? What revenue streams can't they risk? Then build exactly there. They structurally cannot follow you. Startups have nothing to sacrifice — no existing customers, no revenue to protect, no channel conflicts. That's not a weakness. That's the moat."

**Visual:** Two-column comparison. Enterprise: "Map your constraints. Build in the negative space." Startup: "Map their constraints. Build exactly there — they can't follow." Message: "Startups have nothing to sacrifice. That's the moat."

**Leverage Points (Choosing the Right Path):**
- C1: Processes, Values, and Profit Targets Are Structural — the org's identity is the constraint
- C2: Resource Dependence on Existing Customers — you can't serve two masters
- D1: Cannibalization Fear — killing your own revenue is organizational suicide
- N1: No Legacy to Defend — startups have nothing to sacrifice; that's their advantage
- C5: Autonomous Units/Spinouts Rarely Work — parent can't let the child kill the parent
- J1: "Replacing People with Algorithms" = Bad Press — the human cost of sacrifice is visible

### Slide 6a: Barrier #2 — Preparing for the Journey: Enterprise Reality (0:45)

**Summary:** A complex enterprise has a variety of processes serving different customer groups. Each process has differing levels of automation opportunity—some steps are easy to automate, others aren't. The automation opportunities are scattered across the landscape.

**Speaker Notes:** "A complex enterprise has a variety of processes serving different customer groups. Each has differing levels of automation opportunity. Some steps are easy to automate, others aren't. The green shows where AI could help — but notice how scattered it is across the landscape. No single process is fully automatable except one..."

**Visual:** Grid showing 5 processes (A-E) with 10 steps each. Green highlights scattered randomly across all rows showing automation opportunities. Process D happens to be fully green, but it's not called out yet.

### Slide 6b: Barrier #2 — Preparing for the Journey: Startup Opportunity (0:45)

**Summary:** Startups look at the enterprise landscape differently. They find the steps that are automatable ACROSS all processes—the cross-cutting capability—and build a product that does ONLY that slice. They sell it to customers who only need that slice at a fraction of the price.

**Speaker Notes:** "A startup looks at this landscape differently. They find the steps that are automatable ACROSS all processes — the cross-cutting capability. Then they build a product that does ONLY that, and sell it to customers who only need that slice. At a fraction of the price. The enterprise can't respond because their cost structure requires the full process."

**Visual:** Same grid, but columns 3-4 are now highlighted in amber across ALL rows, showing the cross-process automation opportunity. These are the steps that work everywhere—the startup wedge.

### Slide 6c: Barrier #2 — Preparing for the Journey: Enterprise Response (0:30)

**Summary:** The enterprise response should NOT be to chase automation opportunities everywhere—that's scattershot, and you'll never cross the threshold. Instead, find the ONE process that can be 100% automated. Focus there. Use it as a leverage point to expand.

**Speaker Notes:** "The enterprise response should NOT be to chase automation opportunities everywhere — that's scattershot, and you'll never cross the threshold. Instead, find the ONE process that can be 100% automated. Focus there. Use it as a leverage point. Once you've proven the model, expand to adjacent processes. Process D becomes your beachhead."

**Visual:** Same grid, but now Process D is fully highlighted in blue (including the label "Process D"). Columns 3-4 return to green like the rest. The message: focus on the 100% opportunity, not scattered wins.

**Leverage Points (Preparing for the Journey):**
- B1: The 95%→100% Threshold Is Non-Linear — the difference isn't 5%, it's a categorically different business
- B3: AI Rarely Covers 100% of Enterprise Processes — edge cases accumulate over decades
- B4: Diminishing Returns Create a Ceiling — management consultant playbook rewards 80% and moving on
- N2: Pick and Choose Process Slices — startups can specialize where enterprises must generalize
- L1: Serving Nonconsumption — AI makes previously uneconomical services viable
- N4: Target Non-Customers First — build for people who've never used the service category
- D4: Moving Downmarket = Moving to Lower Margins — incumbent cost structures can't support it profitably

### Slide 7a: Barrier #3 — Navigating the Labyrinth: The Problem (2:00)

**Summary:** Transitioning to AI-driven processes requires significant investment in disposable software—systems designed solely to bridge the gap while humans and AI still overlap. Think of early Waymo prototypes: ugly, wire-covered, transitional. Enterprises struggle to justify building infrastructure they know will be thrown away, while startups can build AI-native from day one.

- Hybrid handoff systems don't exist—if AI handles 80% and humans 20%, you need new infrastructure for the transition that wasn't designed for either
- Legacy systems were built for humans clicking through workflows; AI needs APIs, structured data, and different interfaces entirely
- The "vibe-coded" throwaway systems that bridge old and new become permanent technical debt before anyone notices

**Leverage Points (Navigating the Labyrinth):**
- B2: Hybrid Handoff Systems Don't Exist — new engineering project with no direct revenue
- B5: Vibe-Coded Throwaway Systems — prototypes promoted to production without proper engineering
- F1: Legacy Systems Weren't Built for AI — expose UIs not APIs, human-centric workflows
- F4: Decommissioning Legacy Systems Rarely Happens — finance assumes shutdown, reality is parallel running
- F2: Multi-Bot Integration Is an Order of Magnitude Harder — no standards for multi-agent coordination
- F5: AI-Native Tools Emphasize Task-Based Orientation — opinionated tools feel "limited" to enterprises

### Slide 7b: Barrier #3 — Navigating the Labyrinth: Startup Opportunity (0:45)

**Summary:** Startups don't have legacy systems to integrate with. They can build AI-native from day one, avoiding the ugly transitional phase entirely.

**Visual:** Clean architecture diagram vs. spaghetti integration diagram.

### Slide 7c: Barrier #3 — Navigating the Labyrinth: What To Do (0:30)

**Summary:** For enterprises: budget for the ugliness, plan for throwaway bridges. For startups: AI-native architecture is your competitive advantage.

**Enterprise Guidance:**
- Go microservices: Isolate AI experiments in separate services
- Budget the writeoff: Explicitly plan for transitional software depreciation
- Vibe code the greenfield: Use AI to rapidly prototype the throwaway bridges
- Name decommission owner: Someone must be accountable for killing the old system

**Startup Guidance:**
- Easier markets: High employee turnover (less institutional resistance), industries with less legacy software
- Harder markets: Heavily regulated industries, deep legacy integration requirements

### Slide 8a: Barrier #4 — Resisting Temptation: The Math (2:00)

**Summary:** When AI delivers productivity gains, enterprises face a choice: cut costs (fire people) or invest in growth (do more with the same headcount). Cost cutting wins almost every time—not because leaders lack vision, but because it's the rational risk-adjusted choice. Growth is speculative and uncertain; headcount reduction delivers immediate, quantifiable savings that flow straight to the bottom line.

---

#### THE MATH: Why Cost Cutting Always Wins

**Real-World Context:**
- Workday announced 1,750 layoffs (8.5% of workforce) → stock jumped 6.3% the same day
- HP targeting $1B savings by 2028 through 4,000-6,000 AI-driven layoffs
- Microsoft saved $500M through AI integration, laid off 9,000 employees
- CFO survey: Cost control is now priority #1 (38%), revenue growth dropped to #5 (23%)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Enterprise Division
├── Revenue: $30M
├── AI Investment: $1M
├── AI creates: 10% efficiency = $3M in cost savings potential
└── Gross margin: 60%
```

**Option A: Cut Costs**
```
Action:            Cut $3M in labor/operational costs
Profit impact:     +$3M (100% falls to bottom line)
Timeline:          This quarter
Certainty:         ~95% (just execute the layoffs)
Stock reaction:    +6% (see Workday)
```

**Option B: Invest in Growth**
```
Action:            Keep the $3M capacity, pursue new revenue
To match $3M profit: Need $3M ÷ 60% margin = $5M new revenue
That's:            17% revenue growth required just to BREAK EVEN
Timeline:          12-24 months
Certainty:         ~35% (need new customers, longer sales cycles)
Stock reaction:    "They're investing" = margin compression narrative
```

**The Punchline:**
```
Cost cutting IS 17% growth — guaranteed, delivered this quarter.

To match it with actual growth, you need to:
  • Find $5M in new revenue (17% growth)
  • Close it within 12-24 months
  • At only 35% probability of success

Why would any rational CFO choose Option B?
```

**Why CFOs Choose A:**
- 56% of CFOs say they struggle to balance cost cutting with growth investment
- Quarterly earnings pressure rewards certainty
- "We're investing in growth" = "Our margins are declining" to analysts
- Cost savings hit P&L immediately; revenue growth is a spreadsheet fantasy until it closes

---

**Leverage Points (Resisting Temptation):**
- K1: Efficiency vs. Volume Mindset — incumbents see cost reduction; startups see 100x volume expansion
- J1: "Replacing People with Algorithms" = Bad Press — yet cost cutting remains the default because it's certain
- J2: Shareholder Pressure Creates Mixed Signals — cut costs AND maintain good PR simultaneously
- D2: Percentage-Based Valuation Penalizes Lower Margins — Wall Street rewards margin expansion
- D5: Investment Horizon Mismatch — quarterly pressure favors immediate cost savings over long-term growth bets
- E2: Commission-Based Compensation Steers Toward Easy Wins — incentive structures optimize for current business

### Slide 8c: Strategic Response (0:45)

**Summary:** The key insight is not to save in one area and invest in growth elsewhere. Instead, direct AI investments into business units that are already growing. These units are more likely to reinvest the savings into accelerating their growth, creating a multiplier effect. For startups, the layoff announcements are a roadmap to opportunities—every area where enterprises cut headcount is an area they've decided not to compete in.

**Key Points:**
- **Enterprise Strategy:** Don't fight the math—use it. Direct AI investments to growing units because they're more likely to reinvest savings into accelerating growth (multiplier effect), not just cutting costs.
- **Startup Strategy:** Follow the layoffs. Every area where enterprises cut headcount is an area they've decided not to compete in. Build AI-native solutions for the customers they're abandoning.

### Slide 9: The Startup Playbook (1:30)

**Summary:** Consolidate all startup advice from the four barriers into one actionable framework. Every barrier becomes an advantage when you have nothing to lose.

**The Four Plays:**
1. **CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATH:** Map their constraints → build exactly there (they can't follow)
2. **PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY:** 100% of a narrow slice → serve the "$50K floor" (customers incumbents rationally ignore)
3. **NAVIGATING THE LABYRINTH:** AI-native from day one → no legacy to integrate
4. **RESISTING TEMPTATION:** Follow the layoffs → build where they're cutting

**Speaker Notes:** "For startups, every barrier becomes an advantage. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATH: Map their constraints explicitly — who are their sacred customers? Build exactly there. PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY: Don't try to automate 80% of everything — automate 100% of one thing. Find the '$50K floor' in your industry. NAVIGATING THE LABYRINTH: You don't have legacy systems to integrate with — build AI-native from day one. RESISTING TEMPTATION: When enterprises announce layoffs, they're telling you where they've decided not to compete — follow the layoffs."

**Punchline:** You have nothing to sacrifice. That's not a weakness. That's the moat.

### Slide 10: The Enterprise Playbook (1:30)

**Summary:** Consolidate all enterprise advice from the four barriers. The barriers are real — navigate them, don't pretend they don't exist.

**The Four Plays:**
1. **CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATH:** Map constraints explicitly → build in the negative space
2. **PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY:** Find ONE process that's 100% automatable → make it your beachhead
3. **NAVIGATING THE LABYRINTH:** Accept ugly transitions → budget for throwaway bridges
4. **RESISTING TEMPTATION:** Direct AI to growing units → they reinvest the gains (not dying units)

**Speaker Notes:** "For enterprises, the barriers are real. Don't pretend they don't exist. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATH: Map your constraints explicitly — which customers would you compete with? Build in the negative space where constraints don't apply. PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY: Stop scattershotting pilots — find the ONE process that can be 100% automated, make it your beachhead. NAVIGATING THE LABYRINTH: Accept that the transition will be ugly — budget for throwaway infrastructure. RESISTING TEMPTATION: Don't direct AI to dying business units hoping to save them — direct it to growing units who will reinvest."

**Punchline:** Don't fight the structure. Work within it — or around it.
