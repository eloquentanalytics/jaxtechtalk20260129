# Quick summary

Incumbent firms are no longer just passive victims of disruption. In the 2020s they use a mix of structural (ambidexterity / dual transformation), financial (CVC, M&A), technical (AI factories / Centers of Excellence / MLOps), and cultural (reskilling, experimentation) levers to both defend core cashflows and build new AI-native businesses. These moves reframe — rather than contradict — Christensen’s remedies: you still need separation and autonomy, but those teams must also be equipped with data, model infrastructure, and go-to-market pathways. ([Innosight][1])

# How enterprises are trying to overcome the dilemma (concrete patterns)

1. **Dual transformation / organizational ambidexterity — create separate, parallel plays.**
   Leaders run “Transform A” (reposition and defend the core) while simultaneously running “Transform B” (build new, disruptive businesses) — often as independent units with different metrics and incentives. This is the direct evolution of Christensen’s spinoff idea for complex modern incumbents. ([Innosight][1])

2. **Corporate venture & strategic investing (CVC) — buy optionality.**
   Corporations use CVC arms to invest in or partner with startups that are exploring potentially disruptive spaces, gaining visibility, technology access, and potential acquisition targets while avoiding the constraints of the core org. CVCs act as early-warning systems and as optionality engines. ([adlittle.com][2])

3. **AI Factories / Centers of Excellence / MLOps platforms — industrialize AI.**
   Enterprises build repeatable “AI factories” (platforms, model ops, governance) so teams can turn experiments into production at scale and so new product teams don’t repeatedly reinvent infrastructure. This reduces “pilot purgatory” and supplies the data/model plumbing new units need to compete. ([vcluster.com][3])

4. **Partnerships and embedding — integrate rather than out-compete.**
   Incumbents partner, OEM, or embed startup tech into their stack (or vice versa) to accelerate adoption and capture value without completely rebuilding distribution. This also creates a faster path to learn and capture specialized data. ([TechCrunch][4])

5. **Acquisition & product grafting (selective M&A).**
   Rather than trying to build every capability in-house, incumbents acquire startups with complementary tech, user bases, or domain data. The challenge is grafting the startup’s speed/mission to the parent without killing what made it valuable. ([Bain][5])

6. **Data strategy & feedback loops — treat data as a strategic asset.**
   Firms invest in capturing new signals (e.g., capturing inputs where LLMs add value), building labels and instrumentation, and owning the product-to-model feedback loop that creates a sustainable advantage. McKinsey and others emphasize data + model ops as the new economic moat. ([Andreessen Horowitz][6])

7. **Culture, governance, and upskilling — build an AI-ready organization.**
   Technical capabilities alone don’t win: enterprises create CoEs, change funding processes, reassign decision rights, and run large-scale upskilling to align incentives and reduce resistance to new models and workflows. ([tredence.com][7])

# How to reinterpret startup lessons *for* incumbents

* Startups verticalize → incumbents should **verticalize internally or buy vertical plays**: create autonomous, domain-focused teams that control domain data and workflows rather than shoehorning vertical products into general platforms. ([Andreessen Horowitz][6])
* Startups productize workflows → incumbents should **productize AI into internal workflows first** (operational ROI) and external products second; use internal adoption to capture data and prove scale economics. ([B EYE][8])
* Startups use fast iteration → incumbents must **shorten decision loops** (lightweight P&L for experiments, faster procurement for external models, platform-led delivery). CoEs and AI factories help make iteration predictable. ([vcluster.com][3])
* Startups stitch open models → incumbents should have a **build vs buy framework**: own privacy-sensitive or vertical models, compose commodity capabilities from open/third-party models. McKinsey recommends formalizing that split.

# Practical playbook for an enterprise exec (7-step checklist)

1. **Create a clear dual-transformation plan** (defend core + create new). Assign separate leadership, KPIs, and P&Ls. ([Innosight][1])
2. **Stand up an AI Factory / CoE** with standardized MLOps, data contracts, and model governance so teams can go from prototype → production quickly. Monitor the CoE so it doesn’t become a bottleneck. ([vcluster.com][3])
3. **Launch a CVC + partnership program** to invest in and learn from startups; set clear strategic objectives for the CVC (not only financial returns). ([adlittle.com][2])
4. **Identify 1–3 verticals for autonomous product teams** that own the entire workflow and data capture (billing, claims, contracts, etc.). Give them model & data engineering resources. ([Andreessen Horowitz][6])
5. **Formalize build-vs-buy decisions**: which models/data must you own vs assemble? Put procurement, security, and legal pathways in place for rapid third-party model adoption.
6. **Instrument the feedback loop**: build measurement, labeling, and human-in-the-loop processes so product improvements feed model improvements.
7. **Reskill and change incentives**: training, altered performance evaluation, and explicit change-management to reduce the cultural drag on new ventures. ([Agility at Scale][9])

# Five load-bearing claims (and where I pulled them from)

1. **Dual transformation / ambidexterity is the recommended structural remedy for incumbent firms facing disruption.** ([Innosight][1])
2. **Corporate venture capital is being used as a strategic tool to gain optionality on disruptive tech and to partner with startups.** ([adlittle.com][2])
3. **AI Factories / Centers of Excellence + MLOps are how enterprises industrialize AI and reduce pilot-to-production friction.** ([vcluster.com][3])
4. **Data + model infrastructure (feedback loops) are now critical economic moats — owning the data and the loops matters more than raw model chips alone.** ([Andreessen Horowitz][6])
5. **Cultural & governance change (reskilling, decision-rights, funding processes) are as important as technology investments for AI success.** ([tredence.com][7])

# Short risks & pitfalls to watch for

* **CoE as bottleneck:** central teams can slow innovation if they become gatekeepers rather than enablers. Monitor throughput and decentralize when needed. ([Microsoft Learn][10])
* **Misaligned M&A:** acquiring startups but destroying their culture or data flows kills the value of the acquisition. Design acquisition playbooks that preserve speed. ([Bain][5])
* **False security from scale:** incumbents’ distribution advantage can be beaten if startups capture upstream signals or previously inaccessible data (an LLM wedge). Don’t ignore upstream data capture. ([Andreessen Horowitz][6])
